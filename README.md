   - **CSS**: Styling the webpage, including layout (Flexbox, Grid), typography, and colors.
   - **Responsive Web Design**: Media queries and mobile-first design to ensure web apps are usable on all screen sizes.
   - **CSS Preprocessing**: Understanding preprocessors like Sass or LESS for modular, maintainable styles.
   - **Accessibility**: Building accessible websites that work for all users, including those with disabilities.

#### 2.2 **JavaScript Basics**
   - **Core Concepts**: Variables, functions, arrays, and objects.
   - **DOM Manipulation**: Accessing and manipulating HTML elements and handling events like clicks and form submissions.
   - **Asynchronous Programming**: Callbacks, Promises, Async/Await to handle asynchronous tasks like API calls.
   - **ES6+ Features**: Arrow functions, destructuring, template literals, classes, and modules.
   - **Error Handling**: Try/Catch, throwing errors, understanding stack traces.

### **3. Frontend Development**

Once you understand the core web technologies, it’s time to dive into modern frontend development tools and frameworks.

#### 3.1 **Frontend Frameworks / Libraries**
   - **React.js** (most popular frontend library):
     - Components, Props, and State
     - Hooks (useState, useEffect, custom hooks)
     - Functional components vs. class components
     - Component Lifecycle
     - JSX syntax and Virtual DOM
   - **Other frameworks**: Learn alternatives like **Vue.js** or **Angular** depending on job market or project needs.
   - **State Management**: Redux, Context API, or other libraries to manage complex state in large applications.

#### 3.2 **Frontend Tools and Libraries**
   - **Version Control (Git)**: Source control using Git for tracking code changes and collaboration.
   - **Build Tools**: Webpack, Babel, NPM/Yarn for package management and bundling.
   - **CSS Frameworks**: Bootstrap, Tailwind CSS, or Material UI for rapid UI design.
   - **Testing Libraries**: Jest, React Testing Library for unit and integration testing.

### **4. Backend Development**

The backend is the engine that powers web applications. It's important to understand how to build APIs, work with databases, and handle requests securely.

#### 4.1 **Backend Programming Language**
   - **JavaScript (Node.js)**: Learn the basics of Node.js for writing backend code in JavaScript. Express.js is a common framework used with Node.js.
   - **Python**: Django or Flask for building robust web applications using Python.
   - **Ruby**: Ruby on Rails for rapid backend development.
   - **Java or C#**: For enterprise-level applications, often with frameworks like Spring or .NET Core.

#### 4.2 **Databases**
   - **SQL**: Learn relational databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL. Understand tables, joins, primary and foreign keys, and SQL queries.
   - **NoSQL**: Learn document-based databases like MongoDB. Understand collections, documents, and MongoDB-specific queries.
   - **Database Design**: Normalization, indexing, and managing relationships in both SQL and NoSQL databases.

#### 4.3 **APIs (Application Programming Interfaces)**
   - **REST APIs**: Designing and consuming RESTful APIs with HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE).
   - **GraphQL**: Learn how to query data more flexibly with GraphQL.
   - **Authentication**: Implementing secure user authentication (JWT, OAuth2).
   - **Authorization**: Managing user roles and permissions in your application.
   - **API Documentation**: Use tools like Swagger to document APIs.

#### 4.4 **Server and Deployment**
   - **Web Servers**: Understand how web servers like Nginx or Apache work.
   - **Deployment**: Learn how to deploy applications on cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, or Heroku.
   - **Containers**: Learn Docker for containerizing applications.
   - **CI/CD**: Continuous integration and continuous deployment pipelines using GitHub Actions, Jenkins, or GitLab CI.

### **5. Web Security Basics**

Security is an essential part of software engineering. It’s crucial to understand the risks and how to mitigate them.

#### 5.1 **Common Vulnerabilities**
