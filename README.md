# Full Stack Engineering / Software Engineer Curriculum
**Core Foundation**
The curriculum begins with core subjects essential for any software engineer:
1) Computer Networking (Basics)
2) DBMS (Database Management Systems)
3) System Design
4) DSA (Data Structure Algorithms)
5) Operating System

## Computer Network:
A computer network is a system that connects two or more computing devices for transmitting and sharing information. Computing devices include everything from a mobile phone to a server. These devices are connected using physical wires such as fiber optics, but they can also be wireless.

## Computer network fundamentals
Computer network fundamentals include the hardware, software, protocols, and connection medium that make up networks. It also includes the different types of networks, network architecture, and network design.

## Fundamentals of networking including:
**OSI model:**
The Open Systems Interconnection model is a conceptual framework that standardizes the different components required for network communication between various devices by dividing them into distinct layers, allowing different systems to communicate effectively with each other using standard protocols.

**OSI model layers:**
